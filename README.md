# Fishky

This is an iOS app that is a part of my bachelor's thesis. The paper is available [here](https://github.com/krawieck/Fishky/blob/main/Thesis/Praca%20Licencjacka%202025.pdf) (in Polish).

Fishky is a mobile app for creating, storing, and managing flashcards. It allows for studying using active recall.
